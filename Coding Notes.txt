Work on Sell Feature
    • Expected to almost be an opposite of the buy feature
Work on Limit Orders
    • This could involve a lot more work with the API
        ◦ Not really a problem, but more of an issue of time and accuracy
Work on Viewing Portfolio


10/21/22
It is a little late to be starting this, but the project has gotten too complicated for me to remember everything that I have worked on everytime I sit down to work on it.

I need to work putting the finishing touches on the buy feature.

What are the problems with the buy button?
    • When the orders go into the database, they need to be INSERTed (SQL statement vs Stored Procedure) into the customer’s portfolio
    • The customer’s portfolio data table needs to either be
        ◦ USED or
        ◦ REVISED
    • The ability of the customer to view their portfolio is imperative
        ◦ The customer need to know their
            ▪ Trades
            ▪ Cash
            ▪ Pending orders
                • Limit orders (?)
    • CUSTOMER PORTFOLIO - Stocks owned	
        ◦ NO DATE
        ◦ Quantity of stock
        ◦ Dollar cost average ( quantity * cost )
        ◦

Starting screen:
    • S&P500
    • NASDAQ
    • DOW
        ◦ current day ranges, stats

Need to set up SQL statements that will insert and remove stocks from the customer portfolio. This will be done through a stored procedure that is accessed through the DataAccess class SendOrder function.
    • How will I use SQL statements to add or remove stocks from a row?




NOTE FOR NEXT PICKUP:
    • Work on portfolio SQL statements !!!(IMPORTANT)!!!
    • Work on Search Form
    • Work on Sell Form (copy buy form and reverse it)
    • Work on Portfolio Form
    • Find a way to change the color of the daily change percentages on the quote and main form
    • Think about LIMIT ORDERS (Try not to cut, wouldn’t be hard to implement; Just need time)

Worked heavily on the SearchForm. The name search seems to work but none of the textbox values are being moved over from the searchform to the apiprocessor function. maybe move the function in-object?

Also tweaked the depositform to work correctly.

Next Pickup: !!! WORK ON SELL FORM !!!

10/31/22
SELL FORM
Copied, no events added yet
Added a “portfolio” listbox to the form so the user could select a stock to sell from their own portfolio
    • Need to work on stored procedures for adding and subtracting from the portfolio
Added a Transactions Interface for the buy and sell forms
    • SetTotal() - Pretty much the event handler for a quantity change
    • Transact() - Sends the order to the database;

IDEA for adding/subtracting stock to/from portfolio
Create two result models: One for the order going into the portfolio and one List for the current portfolio. 
    • Move the relevant information from the order into the Entry object
    • Use the Entry object and the relevant row from the portfolio to do calculations
        ◦ Quantity
        ◦ DCA = (Total / Quantity)
        ◦ Total

Say I wanted to buy ***MORE*** of a stock, I would need to
    • Transfer the order into an Entry object
    • Compare to the relevant Order object
    • Add the quantities to each other
    • Find the average of the two purchase prices (DCA)
        ◦ Both prices divided by two
        ◦ OR
        ◦ Total / Quantity
    • ALTER the row that contains the previous securities 
    • OR
    • DELETE the old row and put a new row



INTO 11/1/22
IDEA for main dashboard
    • Somewhere next to the CashBox available to trade, put the value of the customer’s portfolio

To uninstall the program, visit the path C:\Users\[USER]\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0 and delete the folder that is NOT “Data”

Worked on a decent publish package. It works but it is a bitch to uninstall. I need to look into writing an uninstall tool.

WORK ON THE TOP MENU

Fixed all windows from the Dashboard to hide the _mainForm upon construction and to show it upon destruction

back to the top menu
Top menu complete. Need to test and implement across all windows

Work on View Portfolio form.
Just struck gold for data display. I was worried about how to display the data in a readable format, so I looked around the tools in the Form designer and found DataGridView. Going to do more research on this display while I construct the Portfolio window

Need to work on displaying the data from the selected row in the DataGridView
Worked on the portfolio form and got super side-tracked trying to learn the DataGridView

11/5/22
Worked on SQL statements to insert an order into the portfolio. The function was debugged all the way down to the final statement, where I ran out of time. The exception that was thrown was the following:
System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: 'An explicit value for the identity column in table 'portfolio' can only be specified when a column list is used and IDENTITY_INSERT is ON.'

The database thinks that I am trying to enter a primary key when that is not the case. The boolean needs to be converted to a BIT type in order to fit into the table.

11/6/22
Trying to find a way to make the published program write and use a file to store and display the cash that is in the user’s account.

The StreamWriter class and the File.WriteAllText function do not create a new file if it does not exist even though the documentation clearly says that they would. A file path is specified, yet a new file is not created. If the user manually creates the .txt, the program will pick it up. This is not optimal and seems utterly ridiculous.




MOVE AWAY FROM STORED PROCEDURES
The SQL Stored Procedures can be used some other time. Use Raw SQL statements in the program where they are needed.
    • The SendOrder function in the DataAccess class needs to be rewritten away from the stored procedure. Time is running out.
